pi_scripts
==========

This repo is a small repo hosting the different scripts I wrote while playing 
with my `raspberry pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_

Being a python developper, these scripts rely on `python-rpi-gpio
<http://code.google.com/p/raspberry-gpio-python/>`_.

Each scripts contains a header explaining what it does.
